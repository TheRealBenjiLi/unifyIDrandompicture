# unifyIDrandompicture

Hi there! This is code used in UnifyID's coding challenge to me on October 10th, 2017. Per instruction, I have published the code on my GitHub. 

To generate a random 128x128 RBG image, follow these instructions:
1. Go to random.org and request an API key. Once you get the API key, edit `apikey.py` and insert your key inside. 
2. Run the `request.py`. This can be done by typing `python3 request.py` in your terminal, assuming you have python3 installed.
